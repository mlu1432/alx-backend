# Pagination Project
## Overview
- This project is designed to explore and implement various pagination techniques in Python. The tasks are focused on creating helper functions and classes that handle data pagination, including hypermedia pagination and deletion-resilient pagination. The project uses a dataset of popular baby names, and each task builds on the previous one, adding more complexity and functionality.
