# Caching Algorithms Project
##Introduction
- This project is an exploration of various caching algorithms, implemented in Python. The caching system utilizes a base class, BaseCaching, that contains a dictionary to store cache data and a maximum limit (MAX_ITEMS). Each caching algorithm extends this base class to implement different policies for managing cache when it exceeds the limit.
